Just some quick, thrown together rubbish...

Haven't had time to make it longer, better (work properly) yet.  I'll try and
release a *finished/bug free* version for the next compo..

Thanks to MrBrown for SBV (which rocks).

This intro uses Hiryu's cool GsLib, and Adresd's modplayer.

It should work on both PAL and NTSC consoles (NTSC lens effect is a bit screwy tho)

Raizor...
