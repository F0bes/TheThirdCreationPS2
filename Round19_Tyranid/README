PS2 Patience

A real crappy game for the PS2, entered for round #19 of TheThirdCreation.

Put simply is it a game of patience (or solitaire if you will :P) for the PS2,
it is mainly a tech demo to show a USB mouse in operation.

If you dont know how to play this game, well, you aint been around computers
very long. 

Only thing to say is double clicking an open card will put it on the ace piles
if it will go. The pack is a single draw type cause I hate 3 card :P

Click DEAL to start the game, its that simple :)

Oh you will need a USB mouse mind.

This will work on pukklink _and_ naplink, and has been tested on an old jap PS2
and a PAL PS2. This game will kill naplink, forcing a manual reset of the PS2. 
This is because it seems impossible to get Naplink and other USB irxes working
together, so I just reset the iop :P This does not affect pukklink/ps2link users
however. 

Disclaimer:
I have sought and been given permission to distribute the Napalm USB driver 
within this game, it is NOT for general distribution commerical or otherwise
so do not ask. In all likelyhood this means that this game cannot be distributed
either without gaining appropriate permission, which you are unlikely to get,
so dont ask. This software should only be made available from thethirdcreation.net
in the context of the round in which it was entered.

On a lighter note :-

Thanx to:

Duke for being generous and giving me permission to distribute his USB driver
Adresd for testing
MrBrown for the amazing lmb patch :)
Sjeep for the rocking packer. Now if I wasn't soo lazy ;)
Whoever drew the cards for the Gnome AisleRiot game. I am much in your debt...

Greetz to:

Blackdroid, Longchair, Jules, Hiryu, Mookie and anyone else I forget on #ps2dev
