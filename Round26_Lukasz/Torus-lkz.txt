"Torus" released on June 5th. 2004 by Lukasz Bruun
===========================================================

Generated wireframe torus, not exactly what i hoped
for, but because of bugs, this is the best i could
do before the deadline.

The demo is written in C++, I will release the source
eventually along with my lib, which is now a C++ graphics
only lib.

Until next time, cya.
