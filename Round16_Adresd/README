                                                                   Version 0.9

Introduction
------------

This is a PS2LIB version of a VU code harness.
It has been developed to let PS2LIB users view and also develop pure VU demos
along the lines of the PS2Linux competition ones.
It is compatible with the Playstation2 Linux VU Competition harness.

It was developed using PS2LIB.

It is compatible with the binary vu files for the Linux harness and loads the
configuration file given with the entries, as is.

It has been tested on both PAL and NTSC machines.

Requirements
------------
A set of the entries from the PS2Linux site, or own VU code files.
Naplink or Pukklink, for host loading of files.
A PS2.
A Joypad connected to PORT1 of your PS2.

Controls
--------
L1 button cycles forwards through the demos.
L2 button cycles backwards through the demos.
SELECT button toggles the help overlay.

Files
-----
Wherever this is run from, using Pukklink or Naplink, it expects a subdirectory
called 'demodata' in the root of the HOST drive.

This directory should contain a 'demotest.ini' file, which gives the entries details.
The format for this file is taken from the PS2Linux competition one for compatibility.

The format is explained below:
(Description,VUcodefilename,VUdatafilename,VUhelpfilename)

Description is the description, shown on overlay info page, max len = 256 chars.
VUcodefilename is the filename of the binary vu code portion (relative to demodata dir)
VUdatafilename is the filename of the binary vu data portion (relative to demodata dir)
VUhelpfilename is the filename of the help overlay text (relative to demodata dir)

for example:
(My Simple VU Text,simple.bin,simple.dat,simple.hlp)

The last ini record must be terminated by a '#' symbol.
Anything added after the '#' is not considered part of the ini file.

Problems
--------
Some entries are not fully working yet, this is being worked on at the moment, but most
of the already released entries work fine with it. As soon as the last ones are fixed then
a new version will be released.
This is mainly to stop ppl moaning to me about the odd one that doesnt seem to work.

Where to get entries
--------------------
The best page to view is:
http://playstation2-linux.com/project/showfiles.php?group_id=99

go there and grab the files, all you want is the demodata directory from each round, and
combine the .ini files to make one big one.

Source Code
-----------
The full source code to the harness will be released soon, as soon as some cleanup is done 
and the last few tiny problems are solved. Possibly sooner.

Specs for VU Code
-----------------
Please refer to the info file within the entries file from playstation2-linux.com, 
for the specs for the vu code and gs mem usage, as their document is the official one
and explains it very well.
