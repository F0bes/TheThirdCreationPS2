"VUME VUU" - Sony Playstation 2 Demo
---------------------------------------------

This is my entry for round #11 of the competition at
http://www.thethirdcreation.net/

Code, Objects and Graphics : adresd
            
Released: 1st March 2003

The demo has been tested on a PAL PS2, and a NTSC machine, it 
was coded for PAL and adapted for NTSC. 

You need naplink or pukklink to run this demo, as it loads an
IOP module from the HOST directory.

If you have an original JAPANESE machine, you may need to put
a LIBSD.IRX in your Host directory, as it doesnt seem to
be present in the BIOS on that machine. The demo will check
for one and load it from the host if not in rom.

You should also have SJPCM.IRX your HOST directory.

SJPCM should be the new V2 one, which is included in the archive
just in case.

If it doesnt find either of these files, it will go into 'no sound'
mode. Bit pointless really, but hey, people have asked for it.

Hope you enjoy,
