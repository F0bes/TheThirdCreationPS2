"BLEND" - Sony Playstation 2 Demo
---------------------------------------------

This is my entry for round #7 of the competition at
http://www.thethirdcreation.net/

Code      : adresd

Music     : No One Home - Roland demo tune converted by Dr.Awesome
Objects &
Graphics  : adresd
            
Released: November 1st 2002

'adresd_blend.elf'
-----------------------
This is the main version, with sound.
The demo has been tested on PAL PS2's, and a NTSC machine, it 
was coded for PAL and adapted for NTSC. 

You need naplink to run this demo, as it loads an IOP module
from the HOST directory.

If you have an original JAP machine, you may need to put
a LIBSD.IRX in your Host directory, as it doesnt seem to
be present in the BIOS on that machine. The demo will check
for one and load it from the host if not in rom.

To Run this demo, SJPCM.IRX needs to be in your NAPLINK host
directory at the root level, if it doesnt find it it wont
run - its that simple.

SJPCM should be the new V2 one, which is included in the archive
just in case.

'adresd_blend_nosound.elf'
--------------------------
This is a version that doesnt have sound in it, it also does not
try to load any IRX's and so should work on pretty much anything.
It is set to run as PAL if it encounters a T10K.



Hope you enjoy,
