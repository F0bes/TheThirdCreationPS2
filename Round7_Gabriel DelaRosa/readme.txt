This is my contribution to the mini-demo competition #7 at The Third Creation.

It is a simple flight simulator for the PS2 and my first attempt at PS2 coding.
It took me about four weeks to learn about basic PS2 programming and to put
together this demo.  It's still kinda buggy but I think the result is still 
pretty good-looking.

It features 
perspective-correct texturing, 
mipmapping, 
bilinear filtering, 
fogging,
alpha-blending,
gourad shading
and full 6-DOF.

The right joystick controls the pitch and roll of the airplane.  Speed is constant.

It should work on PAL consoles but I can't confirm that because I have an NTSC
machine.

I have included the source code for this demo.  Everything is done with the EE and 
the GS, no VU code because I am still learning how to do that.  Most of the code I
copied from Dreamtime's tutorials and the Funslower demo.  Many thanks go to Tony
Saveski for his great tutorials and also thanks to everyone at ps2dev and the homebrew
PS2 community for providing all of the great resources I needed for this demo.

I plan on continuing development on this project so that it will have such things as
external views, enemy airplanes and ground targets, a HUD, a real flight-physics model,
heightmapped terrain, etc.  I hope I will be able to have a bigger, better version
ready for the big demo compo at Third Creation in December.
